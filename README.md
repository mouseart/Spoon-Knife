### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:


###你好！
此存储库旨在提供一个在GitHub上“分叉”存储库的示例。
创建“fork”就是生成其他人项目的个人副本。Forks充当原始存储库和您的个人副本之间的桥梁。您可以提交*Pull Requests*，通过提供对原始项目的更改来帮助他人改进项目。分叉是GitHub社交编码的核心。
分叉此存储库后，您可以对项目进行一些更改，并提交[拉取请求](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls)作为惯例。
有关如何分叉存储库的更多信息，请参阅我们的指南“分叉项目”](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/).谢谢！ :sparkling_heart:
